# Lab 3
## Part 1
### Map of Georgia
![](gggeorgia.png)
> This map shows the Country of Georgia (located between Turkey and Russia, and next to the Black Sea) divided into 12 regions, and 69 districts. Georgia is very mountainous, and the most populated areas are within the two mountain ranges that span the whole country. The capitol of Georgia is Tbilisi, and a majority of the population lives there. This map is made using data from GADM, and the ADM1 and ADM2 values are shown here. The ADM1s are the larger regions while the ADM2s are the small districts within the regions.

## Part 2
### Data from GeoBoundaries
![](geogeorgia.png)
> This map is similar to the one above, but is made using data found in GeoBoundaries. The same information is presented here, however this data set shows that there are different names for the regions, and they are broken up slightly differently compared to GADM. Most likely this is because the geoboudaries information is more recent, and any changed made would show up better in this data rather than GADM. 

### Map of Adjara
![](ajaria.png)
> The Autonomous Region of Adjara is an administrative region within Georgia. It's located in the south western point, bordering the Black Sea and within the Ajar-Imeretinsky and the Shavshetsky mountain ranges. Politically, Adjara was originally part of Turkey, until Russia helped annex the region and attach it to Georgia. It was part of the U.S.S.R. until it dissolved, and is now a Republic within the constitutional framework of Georgia, despite tensions in the past two decades.

### Map of Abkhazia
![](abkhazia.png)
> The Autonomous Region of Abkhazia is located in the northwestern point of Georgia. While it declared its independence in 1999, very few countries acknowledge its independence. The history of Abkhazia is quite convoluted, as Russia has had a lot of authority over the republic, but so has Georgia.

### Map of Tbilisi and Mtskheta-Mtianeti
![](twoarea.png)
> Tbilisi is the capitol of Georgia, and contains no smaller subdivisions within it, according to GADM. It's by far the most populus area within Georgia, while the land area is the smallest. Mtskheta-Mtianeti is a lower populated region bordering Tbilisi to the north. 

### Map of Georgia with Details

> This chart shows the entire country of Georgia with two areas highlighted in detail boxes. Detail A has Tbilisi and Mtskheta-Mtianeti with their given subdivisions. Detail B has Adjara, Guria, and Imereti with their subdivisions as well.
