## Laparoscopic Surgery and Delphi Analysis 

Laparoscopic surgeries have completely changed the medical field in the past decade. The point of this surgical method is to have one or two small incisions in the abdomen, through which the surgery is performed. This leads to fewer complications, shorter recovery time, and more precision in surgical practices (Romanelli, 2009). Laproscopic surgery is done for a multitude of procedures, including gastric bypass and colorectal surgeries (Romanelli, 2009). Before the invention of laparoscopic surgery, everything had to be done with large incisions that would tend to take a month or two to recover from (Campsen, 2018). On top of that, there have been many stories of people accidentally reopening their wounds or going into septic shock because of poor wound care. For these reasons, the development of laparoscopic surgery has been incredibly important. Due to this revolution in recent years, technology has had to become significantly more advanced to make these surgeries safer.
