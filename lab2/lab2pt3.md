## Deliverables
### Return Plot
![](portfreturn.png)
> The stocks that I selected for this project have not been doing great over the past couple months, so the returns on the investment are not incredibly high. As shown in the plot above, there are very low returns currently on the stocks invested.
### Growth Plot
![](portfgrowth.png)
> In the plot above, it shows that if the $10,000 were to be invested into the stocks selected in the quantities specified in the subtitle, there would be about $750 profit. The stocks selected are doing well currently, but they have all gone down since the beginning of the investment period.
