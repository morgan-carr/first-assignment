Hello! My name is Morgan Carr, and I'm from Richmond, VA. I'm hoping to study Environmental Science and Geology. I am also interested in the health field, and I actually took this class to maybe gain a deeper understanding of how this field has been able to revolutionize healthcare. Outside of class, I love learning about film and listening to music. Thank's for visiting my GitHub page!
