Hello! My name is Morgan Carr, and I'm currently a Freshman hoping to 
study Environmental Science and Geology. I took this class to gain a 
deeper appreciation for those who work as data scientists, and understand 
how this field has been able to revolutionize healthcare. 
Thank's for visiting my GitHub page!
